## Project Approach
I have played and watched soccer for over 15 years, I am such a big soccer fan that I decided to use a data science approach to predict soccer player salaries. Maybe it is not too late for me to try a soccer career :)

## Project Summary:
- Statistics for ~1.6K soccer players were scraped and stored in a SQL database on AWS EC2
- Built and cross-validated several linear regression models to predict the player's market values
- Reduce models complexity using regularization techniques such as Lasso for feature selection
- Learned that players' position and age have the strongest impact in predicting player market values
